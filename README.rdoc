ffi-rzmq

== DESCRIPTION:

This gem wraps the ZeroMQ networking library using the ruby FFI (foreign
function interface). It's a pure ruby wrapper so this gem can be loaded
and run by any ruby runtime that supports FFI. That's all of them:
MRI 1.8.7+, 1.9.x, Rubinius and JRuby.

The impetus behind this library was to provide support for ZeroMQ in
JRuby which has native threads. Unlike MRI, MacRuby, IronRuby and
Rubinius which all have a GIL, JRuby allows for threaded access to ruby
code from outside extensions. ZeroMQ is heavily threaded, so until the
other runtimes remove their GIL, JRuby will likely be the best
environment to run this library.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

This gem needs more tests. I'm certain there are a
ton of bugs, so please open issues for them here or fork this project,
fix them, and send me a pull request.

Running this gem with MRI 1.8.x will likely exhibit a LOT of problems in
the form of hangs, segmentation faults and bus errors. The threading support
in MRI 1.8.x is irrevocably broken (according to the brains behind the
Ruby FFI project) so tread carefully.

Running this gem with MRI 1.9.x may also exhibit some hangs particularly at
shutdown. This is due to a signaling interaction between the 0mq library
and MRI. If the 0mq library is blocked on a call and the program receives
a signal (e.g. SIGINT), the Ruby runtime has no opportunity to run its signal
handler and process it. The 2.1.x branch of 0mq resolves this problem by
interrupting the blocking call and returning EINTR. The 2.0.x branch will
not get this fix because the API change breaks backward compatibility.

All features are implemented with the exception of the 0mq devices
(forwarder, queue, streamer). For implementations of these devices, see
the 0mq Ruby reactor project:

== SYNOPSIS:

Client code:
  
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'ffi-rzmq'
  
  if ARGV.length < 3
    puts "usage: local_lat <connect-to> <message-size> <roundtrip-count>"
    exit
  end
  
  bind_to = ARGV[0]
  message_size = ARGV[1].to_i
  roundtrip_count = ARGV[2].to_i
  
  ctx = ZMQ::Context.new
  s = ctx.socket ZMQ::REP
  s.setsockopt(ZMQ::HWM, 100)
  s.bind(bind_to)
  
  roundtrip_count.times do
    msg = s.recv_string 0
    raise "Message size doesn't match, expected [#{message_size}] but received [#{msg.size}]" if message_size != msg.size
    s.send_string msg, 0
  end
  
  # give the lib time to flush any remaining messages
  sleep 1

Server code:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'ffi-rzmq'
  
  if ARGV.length < 3
    puts "usage: remote_lat <connect-to> <message-size> <roundtrip-count>"
    exit
  end
  
  connect_to = ARGV[0]
  message_size = ARGV[1].to_i
  roundtrip_count = ARGV[2].to_i
  
  ctx = ZMQ::Context.new
  s = ctx.socket ZMQ::REQ
  s.connect(connect_to)
  
  msg = "#{ '3' * message_size }"
  
  start_time = Time.now
  
  roundtrip_count.times do
    s.send_string msg, 0
    msg = s.recv_string 0
    raise "Message size doesn't match, expected [#{message_size}] but received [#{msg.size}]" if message_size != msg.size
  end
  
== Better Examples

I highly recommend visiting the Learn Ruby 0mq project for a bunch of good code examples.

== REQUIREMENTS:

  * 0mq 2.0.8 or 2.0.9
  
The ZeroMQ library must be installed on your system in a well-known location
like /usr/local/lib. This is the default for new ZeroMQ installs.

Future releases may include the library as a C extension built at
time of installation.

  * ffi (> 0.6.3)
  
Install the current master version of FFI that fixes several threading problems
under MRI 1.9.x. Unfortunately, MRI 1.8.x is irretrievably broken so it isn't
recommended if you plan to use threads or callbacks.

Code and installation instructions can be found on github:

  http://github.com/ffi/ffi

== INSTALL:

A full gem has been released to rubygems.org as of release 0.5.0.
Make sure the ZeroMQ library is already installed on your system.

 % gem install ffi-rzmq # should grab the latest release


To build from git master:

 % git clone git://github.com/chuckremes/ffi-rzmq
 % cd ffi-rzmq
 % gem build ffi-rzmq.gemspec
 % gem install ffi-rzmq-*.gem
