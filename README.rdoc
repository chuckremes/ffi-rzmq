ffi-rzmq
    by Chuck Remes

== DESCRIPTION:

This gem wraps the ZeroMQ networking library using the ruby FFI (foreign
function interface). It's a pure ruby wrapper so this gem can be loaded
and run by any ruby runtime that supports FFI. That's all of them:
MRI 1.9.x, Rubinius and JRuby.

This single gem supports 0mq 2.2.x and 3.2.x 0mq APIs. The 0mq project started
making backward-incompatible changes to the API with the 3.1.x release.
The gem auto-configures itself to expose the API conforming to the loaded
C library. 0mq API 3.0 is *not* supported; the 0mq community voted to
abandon it.

The impetus behind this library was to provide support for ZeroMQ in
JRuby which has native threads. Unlike MRI, which has a GIL, JRuby and
Rubinius allow for threaded access to Ruby code from outside extensions.
ZeroMQ is heavily threaded, so until the MRI runtime removes its GIL,
JRuby and Rubinius will likely be the best environments to run this library.

Please read the History.txt file for a description of all changes, including
API changes, since the last release!

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

This gem needs more tests. This gem has been battle tested by myself
and others for over a year, so I am fairly confident that it is solid.
However, it is inevitable that there will be bugs, so please open
issues for them here or fork this project, fix them, and send me a pull
request.

The 'ffi' gem has dropped support for MRI 1.8.x. Since this project relies
on that gem to load and run this code, then this project also no longer
supports MRI 1.8.x. I recommend JRuby for the best performance and
stability.

All features are implemented.

== SYNOPSIS:

0mq API v2 client code:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'ffi-rzmq'

  if ARGV.length < 3
    puts "usage: local_lat <connect-to> <message-size> <roundtrip-count>"
    exit
  end

  bind_to = ARGV[0]
  message_size = ARGV[1].to_i
  roundtrip_count = ARGV[2].to_i

  ctx = ZMQ::Context.new
  s = ctx.socket ZMQ::REP
  rc = s.setsockopt(ZMQ::HWM, 100)
  rc = s.bind(bind_to)

  msg = ""
  roundtrip_count.times do
    rc = s.recv_string msg
    raise "Message size doesn't match, expected [#{message_size}] but received [#{msg.size}]" if message_size != msg.size
    rc = s.send_string msg, 0
  end


0mq API v2 server code:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'ffi-rzmq'

  if ARGV.length < 3
    puts "usage: remote_lat <connect-to> <message-size> <roundtrip-count>"
    exit
  end

  connect_to = ARGV[0]
  message_size = ARGV[1].to_i
  roundtrip_count = ARGV[2].to_i

  ctx = ZMQ::Context.new
  s = ctx.socket ZMQ::REQ
  rc = s.connect(connect_to)

  msg = "#{ '3' * message_size }"

  start_time = Time.now

  msg = ""
  roundtrip_count.times do
    rc = s.send_string msg, 0
    rc = s.recv_string msg
    raise "Message size doesn't match, expected [#{message_size}] but received [#{msg.size}]" if message_size != msg.size
  end

== Better Examples

I highly recommend visiting the Learn Ruby 0mq project for a bunch of good code examples.

== REQUIREMENTS:

  * 0mq 2.2.x, 3.2.x or later; 2.0.x, 3.0.x and 3.1.x are no longer supported

The ZeroMQ library must be installed on your system in a well-known location
like /usr/local/lib. This is the default for new ZeroMQ installs.

If you have installed ZeroMQ using brew, you need to `brew link zeromq` before installing this gem.

Future releases may include the library as a C extension built at
time of installation.

  * ffi (>= 1.0.0)

This is a requirement for MRI only. Both Rubinius and JRuby have FFI support built
in as a standard component. Do *not* run this gem under MRI with an old 'ffi' gem.
It will crash randomly and you will be sad.


== INSTALL:

A full gem has been released to rubygems.org as of release 0.5.0.
Make sure the ZeroMQ library is already installed on your system.

 % gem install ffi-rzmq # should grab the latest release


To build from git master:

 % git clone git://github.com/chuckremes/ffi-rzmq
 % cd ffi-rzmq
 % gem build ffi-rzmq.gemspec
 % gem install ffi-rzmq-*.gem


NOTE for Windows users!
In order for this gem to find the libzmq.dll, it *must* be on the Windows PATH. Google
for "modify windows path" for instructions on how to do that if you are unfamiliar with
that activity. That DLL also requires that you copy libstdc++-6.dll and libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll from DevKit MinGW into the same folder that you copied libzmq.dll.
