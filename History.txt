== 0.6.0 / 20100911
  * API Change! Modified ZMQ::Message by removing automatic memory
    management. While doing some performance tests I saw that
    defining/undefining the finalizer added 15-30% processing 
    overhead on the latency test. So, I split this functionality
    out to a subclass called ZMQ::ManagedMemory. Any existing code
    that relies on the default Message class to clean up after itself
    will now have a memory leak. Explicitly call #close on these
    received messages *unless* they are sent out again. The #send
    method automatically closes call on your behalf.

  * Rubinius/rbx compatibility! Requires an rbx code pull from git
    from 20100911 or later to get the necessary code fixes.
  
  * Modify Message to use the @pointer directly rather than indirectly
    via the @struct object. Provides better compatibility for rbx
    since rbx does not yet support the FFI pointer protocol for structs
    like the FFI gem.

  * Modify Message to pass libC's free function for disposing of message
    data buffers rather than trying to callback into ruby code to
    do the same thing. External thread callbacks into ruby code will
    never be supported in rbx; this also improves compatibility and
    performance with MRI and JRuby. (In particular, MRI enqueues these
    kinds of callbacks and spawns a *new* thread to execute each one.
    Avoiding the ruby callback entirely eliminates this extra work
    for MRI.)

  * Modify FFI wrapper to capture the libC dynamic library to fetch
    a pointer to the free function.

  * Modify FFI wrapper to remove the FFI::Function callback used
    by Message. It's no longer necessary since we now use free 
    directly.

== 0.5.1 / 20100830
  * Works with 0mq 2.0.8 release.
  
  * Removed the socket finalizer. The current 0mq framework cannot
    handle the case where zmq_close is called on a socket that was
    created from another thread. Therefore, the garbage collection
    thread causes the framework to break. Version 2.1 (or later)
    should fix this 0mq limitation.
    
  * Misc fixes. See commits.

== 0.5.0 / 20100606
  * Updated the bindings to conform to the 0mq 2.0.7 release.
  Several parts of the API changed.
  
  * Updated all examples to use the new Context api.
  
  * Added Socket#getsockopt.
  
  * Added a Socket#identity and Socket#identity= method pair to
  allow for easy get/put on socket identities. Useful for async
  request/reply using XREQ/XREP sockets.
  
  * Added more specs (slowly but surely).
  
  * Support multi-part messages (new as of 2.0.7). I am unsure how
  to best support multi-part messages so the Message (and related)
  API may change in the future. Added Socket#more_parts?.
  
  * Lots of fixes. Many classes use finalizers to deallocate native
  memory when they go out of scope; be sure to use JRuby 1.5.1 or
  later to get important finalizer fixes.

== 0.4.1 / 20100511
  * I was misusing all of the FFI memory allocator classes. I now
  wrap libc and use malloc/free directly for creating buffers
  used by libzmq.

== 0.4.0 / 20100510
  * Changed the Socket#recv method signature to take an optional
  message object as its first argument. This allows the library
  user to allocate and pass in their own message object for the 
  purposes of zero-copy. Original behavior was for the library to
  *always* allocate a new message object to receive a message into.
  Hopefully this is the last change required.
  
  * Modified the Socket constructor to take an optional hash as its
  final argument. It honors two keys; :receiver_klass and
  :sender_klass. Passing in a new constant for either (or both) keys
  will override the class used by Socket for allocating new
  Message objects. 

== 0.3.1 / 20100509
  * Modified ZMQ::Message so we have both an UnmanagedMessage where
  memory management is manual via the #close method, and Message where
  memory management is automated via a finalizer method run during
  garbage collection.
  
  * Updated ZMQ::Message docs to make it clearer how to use a subclass
  and FFI::Struct to lazily access the message buffer. This gets us as
  close to zero-copy as possible for performance.
  
  * Fixed a memory leak in Message where the FFI::Struct backing the
  C struct was not being freed.
  
  * Tested the FFI code against MRI 1.8.x and 1.9.x. It works!
  
  * Patched a potential problem in LibZMQ::MessageDeallocator. It was
  crashing under MRI because it complained that FFI::Pointer did not
  have a free method. It now checks for :free before calling it. 
  Need to investigate this further because it never happened under
  JRuby.
  
  * Modified the Socket constructor slightly to allow for using
  unmanaged or managed messages.
  
  * Changed the /examples to print a throughput (msgs/s) number upon
  completion.

== 0.3.0 / 20100507
* ZMQ::Socket#send and ZMQ::Socket#recv semantics changed
  * The official 0mq ruby bindings utilize strings for #send and #recv.
    However, to do so requires lots of copying to and from buffers which
    greatly impacts performance. These methods now return a ZMQ::Message
    object which can be subclassed to do lazy evaluation of the buffer.
    
  * Added ZMQ::Socket#send_string and ZMQ::Socket#recv_string. They
    automatically convert the messages to strings just like the official
    0mq ruby bindings.

  * Fixed bug in ZMQ::Util#error_string
  
  * Split the ZMQ::Message class into two classes. The base class called
    UnmanagedMessage requires manual memory management. The Message
    class (used by default by Socket) has a finalizer defined to
    automatically release memory when the message object gets garbage
    collected.
