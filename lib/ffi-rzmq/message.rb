  # The factory constructor optionally takes a string as an argument. It will
  # copy this string to native memory in preparation for transmission.
  # So, don't pass a string unless you intend to send it. Internally it
  # calls #copy_in_string.
  #
  # Call #close to release buffers when you are done with the data.
  #
  # (This class is not really zero-copy. Ruby makes this near impossible
  # since Ruby objects can be relocated in memory by the GC at any
  # time. There is no way to peg them to native memory or have them
  # use non-movable native memory as backing store.)

  # Message represents ruby equivalent of the +zmq_msg_t+ C struct.
  # Access the underlying memory buffer and the buffer size using the
  # #data and #size methods respectively.
  #
  # It is recommended that this class be composed inside another class for
  # access to the underlying buffer. The outer wrapper class can provide
  # nice accessors for the information in the data buffer; a clever
  # implementation can probably lazily encode/decode the data buffer
  # on demand. Lots of protocols send more information than is strictly
  # necessary, so only decode (copy from the 0mq buffer to Ruby) that
  # which is necessary.
  #
  # When you are done using a *received* message object, call #close to
  # release the associated buffers.

  # A subclass of #Message that includes finalizers for deallocating

  # The constructor optionally takes a string as an argument. It will

  #
  # Call #close to release buffers when you have *not* passed this on
  # to Socket#send. That method calls #close on your behalf.
  #
  # When you are done using a *received* message object, just let it go out of
  # scope to release the memory. During the next garbage collection run
  # it will call the equivalent of #LibZMQ.zmq_msg_close to release
  # all buffers. Obviously, this automatic collection of message objects
  # comes at the price of a larger memory footprint (for the
  # finalizer proc object) and lower performance. If you wanted blistering
  # performance, Ruby isn't there just yet.
  #
  # As noted above, for sent objects the underlying library will call close
  # for you.
