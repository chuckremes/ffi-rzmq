  # @blocking = true is a hint to FFI that the following (and only the following)
  # function may block, therefore it should release the GIL before calling it.
  # This can aid in situations where the function call will/may block and another
  # thread within the lib may try to call back into the ruby runtime. Failure to
  # release the GIL will result in a hang; the hint *may* allow things to run
  # smoothly for Ruby runtimes hampered by a GIL.
  #
  # This is really only honored by the MRI implementation.
